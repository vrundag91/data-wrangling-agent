2025-11-27 06:33:01,310 - [INFO] - [DataSteward] - [Reviewer] Complete: Evaluation: **Summary:**

The automated data cleaning job executed successfully without any reported errors. The code effectively addresses all the original issues detected, demonstrating robust handling of missing values, data type conversions, and consistency enforcement for categorical and boolean-like fields. The implementation includes good practices such as checking for column existence, coercing non-numeric values, and using appropriate pandas data types (e.g., `Int64` for nullable integers).

**Detailed Evaluation:**

1.  **Did the code run successfully?**
    Yes, the execution output clearly states "SUCCESS: Done", indicating that the script completed without any runtime errors or exceptions. The `try-except` block also adds robustness for common file-related issues.

2.  **Does the code address the original issues?**
    Yes, the code addresses all the original issues comprehensively:
    *   **Pervasive Missing Values**:
        *   `Blood_Pressure` and `Cholesterol`: NaNs are correctly filled with the median after ensuring the columns are numeric.
        *   `Diagnosis`: NaNs are filled with 'Unknown'.
        *   `Notes`: NaNs are filled with 'No Notes'.
        *   `Smoker`: NaNs are handled as part of its specific cleaning logic (filled with 'No').
    *   **Inconsistent Casing in Categorical Data (`Gender`)**: The `Gender` column is consistently converted to uppercase.
    *   **Inconsistent Data Representation for Boolean-like Field (`Smoker`)**: NaNs in `Smoker` are explicitly filled with 'No', and then the column is correctly mapped to a boolean `True`/`False` representation.
    *   **Suboptimal Data Type (`Age`)**: The `Age` column is correctly converted to `Int64`, which is the appropriate nullable integer type for pandas, handling potential non-numeric entries and NaNs gracefully.

3.  **Quality Score:** 98/100
